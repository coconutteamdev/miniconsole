MiniConsole - A small C# terminal-like program created for fun

==============================Info================================
You can type "help" for a list of commands.
The current commands are:

clear         Clear the screen (remove all the text)
draw [arg]    Draw to the screen (help draw)
help          Show help menu
hi            Say hi

Some commands that have (help [command]) in their help description
can be accessed using: help [command]. Examples includ (help draw), 
and (help prompt).
This project was created in Visual Studio Community 2019 using C#.
============================Releases?=============================
You can compile it yourself using my simple batch script included.
Windows/Linux binaries can be found in the Releases section.
For some reason they compile with a lot of DLLs and I do not know
how to remove them.
===============================Why================================
    I got bored and decided to make this project.
    This was created in C# to see how making a C# program is like.
